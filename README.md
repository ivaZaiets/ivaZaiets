### Hey, guys!

#### I'm Ivanna, front end developer

Currently, I'm actively seeking employment opportunities. 

A bit about my professional background: I have experience working as a React developer,  
where I spearheaded a project from inception. I am proficient in technologies such as  
Next.js, React, Redux, TypeScript, JavaScript, and SCSS. I've collaborated   
with backend developers and designers on projects, and thanks to tools like Jira,   
I've honed my skills in project organization and management. Additionally,  
I'm actively expanding my skill set by delving into the realm of Three.js technology.   

Let's collaborate!
