### Hey, guys!

#### I'm Ivanna, front end developer


Over the past year, I have mastered technologies such as:  
**React**, **Redux**, **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**, **CSS**, **HTML**, **Node.js**, **SQL**, etc. 

I dedicate over **10 hours** a day to coding  
and really passionate about development.

Before entering the field of development, I studied at the **Chinese Language Faculty**  
and thanks to this I developed **good soft skills**  
and also I find it easy **to establish new connections** with other people.  

My skills also include knowledge of **English/Chinese** at the **intermediate** level

It is important for me **to develop professionally**   
and currently I see great potential in combining my skills.
